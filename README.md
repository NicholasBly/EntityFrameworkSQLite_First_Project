# EFSQLiteSample

EFSQLiteSample is a simple console application I made to demonstrate the use of Entity Framework Core with SQLite. This project illustrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and incorporates advanced concepts like delegates for logging database actions into a log.txt file.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete products in a SQLite database.
- **Logging**: Logs actions to both the console and a text file using delegates.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Utilizes EF Core for database operations, providing an abstraction layer for data access.

### Built With:
- [.NET 6.0 SDK or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
